    <h1>Wispy Night 1</h1>

    <p>This work was inspired by a foggy Isla Vista winter night in a very distinctive style. When making this I also envisioned making it into a sticker.</p>

    <img src="IMG_0110.jpg" width="500" />
    <p>This was a really fun 8th grade project that I did with some friends back in 2015. We built a railgun and learned some electrical engineering basics together, It was able to shoot half inch metal cylinders at around 200 ft/sec</p>

    <h1>Balloon Raid V2 2</h1>
    <h4>by Nicolas Ferrari</h4>
    <img src="project2.jpg" width="500" />
    <p>This was part of my final project for two of my classes last summer quarter. It is mixed media, based off of a picture I took in 2015 of Cappadocia, Turkey from a hot-air balloon. </p>
